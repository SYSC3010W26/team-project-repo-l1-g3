Hello Team L1-G3,

At the beginning of the semester, an announcement (instruction) was provided stating the following:
In your group project GitHub repository (not individual or lab repositories), create a folder named WeeklyUpdates.
Inside this folder, create a subfolder for each week.

You have completed Step 1, but Step 2 has not been implemented. So far, all WIPUR submissions have been placed in a single folder.
For the next WIPUR submission, please create a folder named week6 and place your WIPUR report inside that folder.
Failure to follow this structure may result in point deductions.

Thank you.
Gabriel
