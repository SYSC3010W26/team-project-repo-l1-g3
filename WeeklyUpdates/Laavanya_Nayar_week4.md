## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L1-G3
### Student name: Laavanya Nayar
### Week: 4 (Jan 28 – Feb 3)
___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
   9

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   1. Writing/Documenting: 2 hours
   2. Design & Architecture: 1 hour
   3. Team Meetings & Review: 6 hours

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - **Pivoted the system architecture** from a centralized model (where Node 4 was the sole controller) to a cloud-based star topology. This change makes the system more modular and removes Node 4 as a single point of failure.
  - **Created a new UML Deployment Diagram** to accurately reflect the updated star topology for the final proposal submission.
  - **Performed a final review** of the entire proposal document, ensuring a consistent technical voice throughout.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel confident about our direction. After a critical recalibration of our design, I believe we have made a much better choice. The new architecture is more robust, scalable, and a stronger foundation for the project.

5. ***What are you planning to do next week?*** _(give specific goals)_
  - Place the order for our specific sensors (DS18B20) and actuators (servos, relay) to ensure they arrive in time for our hardware labs.

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No blocks currently. The team is aligned and ready to move on to the implementation phase.
