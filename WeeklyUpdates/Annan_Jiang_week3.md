1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
7 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Information gathering / Research: 3 hours (Learning Firebase and IoT protocols in Lab 3)
   2.  Meetings: 2 hours (Discussing project scope with the TA and coordinating the proposal draft with teammates)
   3. Writing/Documenting: 2 hours (Drafting the initial project statement and UML diagrams for the proposal)
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
Collaborated with the group to start the Project Proposal draft, specifically focusing on the overview spec of the system rather than implementation details.
Created a preliminary UML Deployment Diagram to map out our hardware nodes and software components.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
I feel confident after seeing how Firebase simplifies the backend logic, but I am aware that we need to stay disciplined to meet the proposal deadline early next week.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
 Finalize and submit the revised Project Proposal by January 30.
Submit WIPUR 2 by next Friday.

Begin prototyping the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to avoid a last-minute rush at the end of the term.

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
Waiting for final feedback from all group members on the Component Ordering form to ensure we have everything needed for the hardware implementation.
