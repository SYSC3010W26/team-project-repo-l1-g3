I feel good about the progress this week because I strengthened my understanding of the lab foundations and used that to improve my existing work.

What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)

Continue refining my component during reading week by applying what I reviewed from Labs 1–5

Clean up documentation/comments and do basic testing to make integration smoother later
