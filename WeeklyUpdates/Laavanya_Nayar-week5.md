___

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
   9

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   1. Writing/Documenting: 2 hours  
   2. Researching alternative parts available on DigiKey: 5 hours  
   3. Team Meetings & Review: 2 hours

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
   - **Attended one team meeting** where we discussed project component requirements and confirmed the sensors, actuators, and hardware needed for our Raspberry Pi nodes.
   - **Researched and documented parts availability on DigiKey**, checking pricing, compatibility, and viable alternatives for components such as temperature sensors, servos, relay modules, motors, and distance sensors.
   - **Compared multiple component options** to ensure they would function correctly within our voltage, interfacing, and control constraints.
   - **Completed and filled out the official parts order form** based on the finalized and verified component list.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
   - I feel good about my progress this week. Finalizing and verifying the parts list was important to ensure we order compatible components and avoid delays during hardware integration.

5. ***What are you planning to do next week?*** _(give specific goals)_
   - Follow up on the parts order and confirm delivery timelines.
   - Begin preparing wiring diagrams and GPIO mappings for the ordered components.
   - Start initial software setup for sensor reading and actuator control.

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
   - No current blockers. I am waiting for the ordered components to arrive so hardware testing can begin.
